            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p class="bio-par">
                <sup>1</sup> I, <strong>Kimi Bayran</strong>, remember playing a lot when I was a kid because those were the <strong>happiest times of my life</strong>.
                <sup>2</sup> My favorite cartoon to watch back then was <strong>Mr. Bean</strong> because it always made me laugh.
                <sup>3</sup> I also loved watching <strong>Cars</strong>, especially <strong>Lightning McQueen</strong>, since he was my favorite character.
                <sup>4</sup> I liked playing with <strong>Legos</strong> because it allowed me to build anything I imagined.
                <sup>5</sup> There was also a time when <strong>spider fighting</strong> became very popular in our neighborhood.
                <sup>6</sup> I collected many spiders and felt proud showing them to my cousins.
                <sup>7</sup> My cousin and I would battle our spiders to see whose was stronger.
                <sup>8</sup> I would always ask my dad to buy me new spiders so I could train them.
                <sup>9</sup> My dad helped me take care of them so they would grow strong.
                <sup>10</sup> I enjoyed feeding them and watching them move around in their small containers.
                <sup>11</sup> Those moments made my childhood feel <strong>exciting and adventurous</strong>.
                <sup>12</sup> When I was in <strong>Grade 1</strong>, I suddenly became lazy and didn’t want to attend school anymore.
                <sup>13</sup> I remember <strong>pretending to feel sleepy</strong> just so I could skip class.
                <sup>14</sup> My parents would still push me to go because they knew it was important.
                <sup>15</sup> Even though I resisted, I still learned to enjoy school little by little.
                <sup>16</sup> I made a few friends who made school more fun for me.
                <sup>17</sup> I also loved lunchtime because it was when we shared snacks.
                <sup>18</sup> I enjoyed going home after school because I could watch TV again.
                <sup>19</sup> Childhood felt <strong>simple and carefree</strong>, and I wish I could relive some of those moments.
                <sup>20</sup> Looking back, those experiences <strong>shaped a big part of who I am today</strong>.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p class="bio-par">
                <sup>1</sup> My teenage years have been one of the <strong>best chapters of my life</strong>.
                <sup>2</sup> When I was in Grade 7 and 8, I made many memories with my friends.
                <sup>3</sup> We always <strong>played basketball after class</strong> because it was our favorite pastime.
                <sup>4</sup> We laughed, argued, and competed, but those moments brought us closer.
                <sup>5</sup> Then the <strong>pandemic suddenly happened</strong> and everything changed.
                <sup>6</sup> Our normal routine disappeared, and we all had to stay inside our homes.
                <sup>7</sup> During the lockdown, <strong>I gained weight</strong> because we could not go out.
                <sup>8</sup> All we did was play <strong>Mobile Legends and Valorant</strong> with my friends online.
                <sup>9</sup> Those games became our way of <strong>staying connected</strong> despite the distance.
                <sup>10</sup> It felt strange at first because everything was so uncertain.
                <sup>11</sup> After several months, the school announced that classes would shift to <strong>online learning</strong>.
                <sup>12</sup> I continued attending online classes from Grade 8 until Grade 10.
                <sup>13</sup> It was challenging because it felt different from traditional school.
                <sup>14</sup> Sometimes I struggled because the lessons felt <strong>harder to learn through a screen</strong>.
                <sup>15</sup> But I also enjoyed being in the <strong>comfort of my home</strong>.
                <sup>16</sup> I learned how to manage my time and responsibilities more independently.
                <sup>17</sup> My teenage years taught me about <strong>adapting to unexpected changes</strong>.
                <sup>18</sup> They also reminded me how <strong>important friendships are</strong> even during hard times.
                <sup>19</sup> Even though the pandemic was difficult, it became a <strong>huge part of my story</strong>.
                <sup>20</sup> Those years will always be memorable because they <strong>shaped my growth</strong>.

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p class="bio-par">
                <sup>1</sup> <strong>College truly humbled me</strong> and made me see life from a new perspective.
                <sup>2</sup> There are times when I question myself if this program is really meant for me.
                <sup>3</sup> Some days feel so <strong>overwhelming</strong> that I wonder if I chose the right track.
                <sup>4</sup> The lessons are harder, and the workload is heavier than I expected.
                <sup>5</sup> I realized that succeeding in college requires <strong>patience and discipline</strong>.
                <sup>6</sup> I also learned that <strong>time management is crucial</strong> if I want to survive every semester.
                <sup>7</sup> There are moments when the pressure gets too strong, but I continue pushing forward.
                <sup>8</sup> I met new people who helped me feel less alone in my journey.
                <sup>9</sup> Some classmates eventually became my close friends.
                <sup>10</sup> We help each other during difficult subjects and stressful projects.
                <sup>11</sup> I learned that <strong>teamwork is important</strong>, especially in group tasks.
                <sup>12</sup> College also taught me how to be <strong>more responsible with my decisions</strong>.
                <sup>13</sup> I experienced <strong>sleepless nights</strong> because of deadlines and exams.
                <sup>14</sup> Those nights showed me how <strong>determined</strong> I can be when I set my mind to something.
                <sup>15</sup> Even though the challenges are tough, they help me <strong>grow into a stronger person</strong>.
                <sup>16</sup> I discovered new things about myself that I didn’t notice before.
                <sup>17</sup> My college life is not perfect, but it is <strong>meaningful</strong>.
                <sup>18</sup> Every struggle I face becomes a lesson that I carry with me.
                <sup>19</sup> Even with all the doubts, I still believe I can <strong>finish what I started</strong>.
                <sup>20</sup> My journey in college continues, and I know it will help <strong>shape my future</strong>.
